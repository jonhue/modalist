# Modalist

Modalist is a powerful ajaxified modal plugin. Here is how it works:

1) You trigger a modal opening from your frontend code
2) Modalist fetches the modal contents with AJAX
3) The modal opens

Modalist does not reinvent the wheel and uses todays best modal-engine [iziModal.js](https://github.com/dolce/iziModal) to backup its code.

Utilize the [gem](https://github.com/jonhue/modalist) when using modalist.js with Rails.

## Usage

First make sure to add the necessary HTML markup to your `body` tag:

```html
<div id="modalist"></div>
```

### Trigger a modal

There are numerous ways to trigger/open a modal with Modalist.

One options is to open the modal by calling a JavaScript function - more on that [here](#functions).

#### Links

The most common scenario is using a link to trigger the opening of a modal:

```haml
<a class="modalist--trigger" href="https://jonhue.me/settings/modal">Open modal</a>
```

You can use [data attributes](#options) to pass options customizing the modal.

#### Forms

When you want to open a modal after submitting a form - this is as simple as it gets:

```haml
<form action="https://jonhue.me/settings/modal" method="GET">
<!-- ... -->
<input type="submit" class="modalist--trigger" data-modalist-form="true" />
</form>
```

You can use [data attributes](#options) to pass options customizing the modal.

#### Elements

You can also trigger a modal from any other HTML element in your view:

```haml
<div class="modalist--trigger" data-modalist-url="https://jonhue.me/settings/modal"></div>
```

You can use [data attributes](#options) to pass options customizing the modal.

### Modalist functions

Modalist's JavaScript component provides a set of functions to handle your modals:

#### Open modals

```js
Modalist.open({ url: 'https://jonhue.me/settings/modal' });
```

You can pass [options](#options) to customize the modal:

```js
Modalist.open({
    url: 'https://jonhue.me/settings/modal',
    form: false,
    fullScreen: false
});
```

#### Close modals

```js
Modalist.close();
```

### Options

**`url`:** URL to fetch content of the modal from. Takes a string.

**`form`:** Submit a form and use the response to populate the modal. Takes a string to specify a jQuery selector for the form or `false`.

**`fullScreen`:** Show a full screen modal instead of the default windowed modal. Takes a 'true', `'mobile'` (uses a full screen modal on devices smaller than `800px`) or `false`.

### Events

Modalist emits events that allow you to track the navigation lifecycle and respond to content loading. Modalist fires events on the `$(document)` object.

* `modalist:click` fires when you click a Modalist enabled link to trigger a modal opening. The clicked element is the event target. Access the requested location with `event.data.url`.

* `modalist:request-start` fires before Modalist issues a network request to fetch the modal content.

* `modalist:request-end` fires after the network request completes.

* `modalist:before-render` fires before rendering the content.

* `modalist:render` fires after Modalist renders the content in the modal.

* `modalist:load` fires after Modalist completed preparing and opened the modal.
